IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.
*********************/

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/forms";

// designs
@import "modules/design";

/*********************
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
*********************/

// styles in base.scss
@import "breakpoints/base";

/*********************
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 481px) {

	// styles in 481up.scss
	@import "breakpoints/481up";

} // end of media query

/*********************
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {

	// styles in 768up.scss
	@import "breakpoints/768up";

} // end of media query

/*********************
DESKTOP
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 1030px) {

/*********************
LARGE VIEWING SIZE
This is for the larger monitors and possibly full screen viewers.
*********************/

	@import "breakpoints/1240up";

/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
